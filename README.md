Giftdriver is generosity powered software for organizing Adopt-a-Family gift drives that are sponsored by non-profit organizations working directing with youth and families. 

Giftdriver started as a seven day Dev Bootcamp final project to build a web application from scratch. Contributors are: [Paulette Luftig](https://github.com/pyluftig), [Lillie Chilen](https://github.com/lilliealbert), and [Brian Pope](https://github.com/pope1280).

This application is still in development but is intended for use by any organization hoping to streamline its donations and gift-giving programs.
