Giftdriver is generosity powered software for organizing Adopt-a-Family gift drives that are sponsored by non-profit organizations working directing with youth and families. 

Giftdriver started as a seven day Dev Bootcamp final project to build a web application from scratch. Contributors are: <a href="https://github.com/pyluftig">Paulette Luftig</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lilliealbert">Lillie Chilen</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pope1280">Brian Pope</a>.

This application is still in development but is intended for use by any organization hoping to streamline its donations and gift-giving programs.
